# ModelViewPresenter_ListView

An experimental project implementing the Model View Presenter pattern using Activities utilising Android's List View. Dependancy injection is also implemented using Dagger 2 along with View injection provided by Butter Knife.

I have made a Kotlin equivalent of this project to help those trying to get familiar with Kotlin syntax. Feel free to fork this project and `KotlinMVPExample` found in my repo and study the key differences to get used to the difference in syntax.
